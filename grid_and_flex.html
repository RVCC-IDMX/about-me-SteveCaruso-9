        <p>It's cold, but it's beautiful. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck.
            They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset
            the critics.</p>

        <p>If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Let's build an almighty mountain. Only God can
            make a tree - but you can paint one. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Now let's put
            some happy little clouds in here.</p>

        <p>We'll play with clouds today. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. If you don't like it - change it.
            It's your world. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't
            shoot Bambi except with a camera.</p>

        <p>You're meant to have fun in life. Let your imagination be your guide. The light is your friend. Preserve it.
            Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Be so very light. Be a
            gentle whisper. And right there you got an almighty cloud.</p>

        <p>The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can
            experience it. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. This is a
            fantastic little painting.</p>

        <p>A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Look around,
            look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. But they're very easily killed.
            Clouds are delicate. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.</p>

        <p>As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Have fun with it. All those little son of a guns. Very easy
            to work these to death.</p>
